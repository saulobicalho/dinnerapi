Obs: this project first intended to be a practical usage of tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxofwuWTs7c, which covers basic API usage on py (Django).
But API service used on it, from dev.locu,is no longer avaliable for new signers, so it cannt be taken along.
So, despite the initial name and purpose (to provide restaurant localization), dinnerapi now directs to apply some other usage of API.
